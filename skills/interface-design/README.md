# Interface Design Skill

The Interface Design skill provides expert guidance for building crafted dashboards, admin panels, SaaS apps, tools, and interactive products. It teaches intent-driven design over template defaults, covering subtle layering, token architecture, product domain exploration, typography hierarchy, spacing systems, and design validation checks.

## Purpose

When you need to build interfaces that feel designed rather than generated, this skill encodes the craft principles that separate professional output from generic AI templates. It forces deliberate choices at every level — from CSS variable naming to surface elevation — ensuring each decision traces back to the product's specific context, users, and intent.

## When to Use

- When building dashboards, admin panels, or data-heavy interfaces.
- When designing SaaS application UIs with navigation, cards, and forms.
- When you need a design system with token architecture, spacing scales, and elevation hierarchy.
- When output feels generic and you need structured checks to identify where defaults crept in.

## Key Features

- **Intent-first workflow** — forces articulation of who, what, and feel before any code.
- **Product domain exploration** — structured process to discover domain-specific colors, metaphors, and signatures.
- **Subtle layering system** — surface elevation, border progression, and depth strategies.
- **Token architecture** — primitive-based color system with text hierarchy, border scales, and control tokens.
- **Design validation checks** — swap test, squint test, signature test, and token test.
- **Reference files** — deep dives on principles, critique protocol, craft examples, and memory management.

## Reference Files

This skill includes supplementary reference documents in `references/`:

- **principles.md** — Core craft principles with code examples and specific values.
- **critique.md** — Post-build craft critique protocol for identifying defaults.
- **example.md** — Subtle layering in action with real decision breakdowns.
- **validation.md** — Memory management and consistency checks for system.md.
