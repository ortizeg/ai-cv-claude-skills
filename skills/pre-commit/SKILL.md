# Pre-commit Hooks for Python and ML Projects

## Overview

Pre-commit is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. It runs a set of checks automatically before every `git commit`, catching issues early in the development cycle before they reach code review or CI. For Python and machine learning projects, pre-commit is essential for enforcing consistent code style, catching type errors, preventing secrets from leaking, and keeping large files out of the repository.

## Why Use Pre-commit

Without pre-commit hooks, developers must remember to run formatters, linters, and type checkers manually before committing. This leads to inconsistent code quality, noisy diffs from formatting changes mixed with logic changes, and wasted CI minutes catching trivial issues. Pre-commit solves all of these problems by automating checks at the point of commit.

Key benefits:

- **Consistent code style** across all contributors without manual effort.
- **Early error detection** before code reaches CI pipelines.
- **Prevents accidental commits** of secrets, large files, or merge conflicts.
- **Faster code reviews** because reviewers focus on logic, not style.
- **Reproducible environments** with pinned hook versions.

## Installation and Setup

Install pre-commit using pip or pixi:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install pre-commit

# Using pixi (recommended for this project)
pixi add pre-commit --feature dev

# Verify installation
pre-commit --version
```

After installing, create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your repository and install the hooks:

```bash
# Install hooks into your .git directory
pre-commit install

# Also install commit-msg hooks if needed
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Once installed, pre-commit will run automatically on every `git commit`. Only the files being committed (staged files) are checked, making it fast for incremental work.

## Hook Configuration for Python and ML Projects

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file defines which hooks run and in what order. Here is a comprehensive configuration suitable for Python-based computer vision and machine learning projects:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.6.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
        args: ['--maxkb=5000']
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: detect-private-key

  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.8.4
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix, --exit-non-zero-on-fix]
      - id: ruff-format

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.11.2
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
        additional_dependencies:
          - types-PyYAML
          - types-requests
          - pydantic
```

### Understanding Each Section

The `pre-commit-hooks` repository provides general-purpose hooks:

- **trailing-whitespace**: Removes trailing whitespace from lines. Prevents noisy diffs.
- **end-of-file-fixer**: Ensures files end with a newline. Required by POSIX standard.
- **check-yaml**: Validates YAML syntax. Catches broken config files early.
- **check-added-large-files**: Prevents accidentally committing large files (models, datasets). The `--maxkb=5000` argument sets a 5 MB limit.
- **check-merge-conflict**: Detects leftover merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`).
- **detect-private-key**: Prevents committing private keys (SSH, RSA, etc.).

## Ruff Integration

Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust. It replaces Flake8, isort, Black, and many other tools in a single binary. The pre-commit configuration runs two hooks:

### Ruff Linter

```yaml
- id: ruff
  args: [--fix, --exit-non-zero-on-fix]
```

The `--fix` flag automatically fixes safe issues (unused imports, import sorting). The `--exit-non-zero-on-fix` flag ensures the hook fails when fixes are applied, so you can review the changes before committing.

Configure Ruff in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py312"
line-length = 88

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    "E",    # pycodestyle errors
    "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
    "F",    # pyflakes
    "I",    # isort
    "N",    # pep8-naming
    "UP",   # pyupgrade
    "B",    # bugbear
    "SIM",  # simplify
    "ANN",  # annotations
    "S",    # bandit (security)
    "A",    # builtins
    "C4",   # comprehensions
    "DTZ",  # datetime
    "RUF",  # ruff-specific
]
ignore = ["ANN101", "ANN102"]

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/**" = ["S101", "ANN"]
```

### Ruff Formatter

```yaml
- id: ruff-format
```

Ruff format is a drop-in replacement for Black. It formats code deterministically, ensuring all contributors produce identical output. No additional configuration is needed beyond `line-length` set above.

## MyPy Integration

MyPy performs static type checking on Python code. It catches type errors before runtime, which is especially valuable in ML projects where tensor shape mismatches and incorrect data types are common bugs.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
  rev: v1.11.2
  hooks:
    - id: mypy
      additional_dependencies:
        - types-PyYAML
        - types-requests
        - pydantic
```

The `additional_dependencies` field installs type stubs that MyPy needs to check code that uses those libraries. Without them, MyPy would report missing stub errors.

Configure MyPy in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.12"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true

[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = ["cv2.*", "albumentations.*", "torchvision.*"]
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

The `ignore_missing_imports` override is necessary for libraries that do not ship type stubs, which is common in the computer vision ecosystem.

## Custom Hooks

You can define custom hooks for project-specific checks. Here are two useful examples:

### No Large Files Hook (Custom)

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: no-model-files
      name: Check for model files
      entry: bash -c 'for f in "$@"; do case "$f" in *.pt|*.pth|*.onnx|*.pkl|*.h5) echo "ERROR: Model file $f should not be committed. Use DVC instead." && exit 1;; esac; done'
      language: system
      types: [file]
```

### No Secrets Hook (Custom)

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: no-secrets-in-config
      name: Check for hardcoded secrets
      entry: bash -c 'if grep -rn "api_key\s*=\s*[\"'\''][^\"'\'']*[\"'\'']" "$@" 2>/dev/null; then echo "ERROR: Possible hardcoded API key detected." && exit 1; fi'
      language: system
      types: [python]
```

### Validate Hydra Configs

```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: validate-configs
      name: Validate Hydra configs
      entry: python -c "import yaml, sys; [yaml.safe_load(open(f)) for f in sys.argv[1:]]"
      language: python
      types: [yaml]
      additional_dependencies: [pyyaml]
```

## Running Manually

You do not need to wait for a commit to run hooks. Manual execution is useful during development and debugging:

```bash
# Run all hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a specific hook on all files
pre-commit run ruff --all-files

# Run all hooks on specific files
pre-commit run --files src/model.py src/data.py

# Run a specific hook on specific files
pre-commit run mypy --files src/model.py

# Run hooks on staged files only (same as what runs on commit)
pre-commit run

# Update all hooks to their latest versions
pre-commit autoupdate

# Clean cached hook environments
pre-commit clean
```

## CI Integration

Pre-commit should also run in CI to catch cases where developers bypass local hooks (using `--no-verify`). Here is a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pre-commit.yml
name: Pre-commit

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"

      - name: Install pre-commit
        run: pip install pre-commit

      - name: Cache pre-commit hooks
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/pre-commit
          key: pre-commit-${{ hashFiles('.pre-commit-config.yaml') }}

      - name: Run pre-commit
        run: pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
```

The `--show-diff-on-failure` flag displays exactly what the formatter would change, making it easy to fix issues locally.

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Fails After Update

When updating hook versions, cached environments may become stale:

```bash
# Clear all cached hook environments
pre-commit clean

# Reinstall hooks
pre-commit install
```

### MyPy Reports Missing Imports

If MyPy cannot find imports for your project's own modules, ensure the `mypy` hook knows about your source layout:

```yaml
- id: mypy
  args: ["--namespace-packages", "--explicit-package-bases"]
  additional_dependencies:
    - types-PyYAML
    - types-requests
    - pydantic
```

Or set `MYPYPATH` in your environment.

### Ruff and MyPy Conflict on Unused Imports

Ruff may auto-remove imports that MyPy needs for type checking. Use `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from pathlib import Path
    from torch import Tensor

def process(image_path: Path) -> Tensor:
    ...
```

### Hooks Are Slow

If hooks take too long, consider running only on changed files (the default) and moving expensive checks like MyPy to CI only:

```yaml
- id: mypy
  stages: [manual]  # Only runs with: pre-commit run mypy --all-files
```

### Skipping Hooks Temporarily

During rapid prototyping, you may need to skip hooks:

```bash
# Skip all hooks for a single commit
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: prototype"

# Skip specific hooks
SKIP=mypy git commit -m "Quick fix"
```

Use this sparingly. CI should still catch any issues.

## Best Practices

1. **Pin all hook versions** using `rev` to ensure reproducibility.
2. **Run `pre-commit autoupdate` monthly** to pick up security fixes and new rules.
3. **Keep hooks fast**. Move slow checks (integration tests, full MyPy runs) to CI.
4. **Document your hooks** in the project README so new contributors know what to expect.
5. **Use `additional_dependencies`** for MyPy stubs rather than expecting them in the global environment.
6. **Always run pre-commit in CI** as a safety net against `--no-verify`.
7. **Configure file exclusions** for generated code, vendored files, or notebooks that should not be checked:

```yaml
- id: ruff
  exclude: ^(notebooks/|generated/)
```

## Summary

Pre-commit hooks are a lightweight, high-impact addition to any Python or ML project. By catching formatting issues, lint errors, type problems, and accidental secret or large file commits before they reach version control, pre-commit keeps the codebase clean and the development workflow efficient. Combined with CI enforcement, it ensures that code quality standards are maintained consistently across the entire team.
