# Skills Overview

Skills are the core building blocks of the AI/CV Claude Skills framework. Each skill is a focused knowledge module that teaches Claude Code how to use a specific tool, library, or pattern correctly in the context of computer vision and deep learning projects.

## How Skills Work

Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/` and contains:

- **`SKILL.md`** -- The full skill definition loaded by Claude Code. Contains coding conventions, templates, anti-patterns, and integration guidance.
- **`README.md`** -- Human-readable overview of the skill's purpose and scope.
- **`configs/`** -- Example configuration files relevant to the skill.
- **`examples/`** -- Sample code demonstrating the skill in action.

When you reference a skill in a Claude Code session, Claude reads the `SKILL.md` and uses its contents to guide code generation. The skill does not execute code -- it provides expert context that shapes Claude's output.

## Choosing Skills

### By Project Phase

| Phase | Recommended Skills |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Starting a new project** | Master Skill, Code Quality, Pixi, Pydantic Strict |
| **Building models** | PyTorch Lightning, Hydra Config |
| **Training & experiments** | W&B or MLflow, TensorBoard |
| **Preparing for production** | Docker CV, ONNX, Testing, Pre-commit |
| **Publishing & sharing** | PyPI, GitHub Actions, DVC |

### By Role

| Role | Recommended Skills |
|------|-------------------|
| **Researcher** | PyTorch Lightning, Hydra Config, Matplotlib, TensorBoard |
| **ML Engineer** | All Core + Training + Infrastructure |
| **CV Engineer** | OpenCV, PyTorch Lightning, ONNX, Docker CV |
| **DevOps/MLOps** | Docker CV, GitHub Actions, DVC, Pixi |

## Combining Skills

Skills are designed to compose. When you load multiple skills, Claude Code merges their conventions. A few guidelines:

1. **Always include the Master Skill** -- It sets the baseline conventions that other skills build on.
2. **Pick one experiment tracker** -- Use W&B, MLflow, or TensorBoard, not all three (unless migrating).
3. **Infrastructure skills are additive** -- Docker, CI/CD, and Pre-commit never conflict with each other.
4. **Start small, add incrementally** -- Begin with 2-3 skills, then layer on more as the project grows.

## Skill Completeness

Each skill is validated by automated tests that check:

- `SKILL.md` exists and contains 500+ characters of content
- `SKILL.md` includes code examples (fenced code blocks)
- `SKILL.md` includes structural headers
- `README.md` exists and explains the skill's purpose

Run the validation suite:

```bash
pixi run pytest tests/test_skills_completeness.py -v
```
