# Data Engineer Agent

Advisory agent specialized in data pipeline architecture, data quality, and data lifecycle management for ML/CV projects.

## Purpose

This agent guides the design and implementation of robust data pipelines for computer vision and machine learning workflows. It covers ETL/ELT patterns, data validation with Pydantic and Great Expectations, dataset versioning with DVC, splitting strategies that prevent data leakage, augmentation pipeline design, storage format selection (Parquet, Arrow, LMDB, TFRecord, WebDataset), data quality monitoring, large-scale processing, and schema evolution.

## Strictness Level

**ADVISORY** — This agent suggests best practices and warns about anti-patterns but does not block commits or CI pipelines.

## When to Use

- Building data ingestion or ETL pipelines for image datasets.
- Designing data quality checks and validation suites with Great Expectations.
- Choosing storage formats (Parquet vs. LMDB vs. WebDataset vs. TFRecord).
- Setting up dataset versioning with DVC and cloud remotes.
- Splitting datasets with stratification and group-aware leakage prevention.
- Designing data augmentation pipelines with Albumentations.
- Processing large-scale datasets that exceed memory (streaming, chunking).
- Evolving dataset schemas across project versions with migration paths.
- Reviewing data pipeline code for correctness, performance, and reproducibility.

## Example Session

```
You: "I have 500K medical images from 2,000 patients. How should I organize the data pipeline?"

Data Engineer Agent: "For medical imaging at this scale, I recommend:
1. Store images in LMDB for fast random access during training
2. Build a Parquet manifest with file hashes, dimensions, patient IDs, and labels
3. Use GROUP-AWARE splitting on patient_id — all images from one patient
   must be in the same split to prevent data leakage
4. Version everything with DVC using an S3 remote
5. Add Great Expectations validation: no nulls, no duplicate hashes,
   valid dimensions, balanced class distribution per split
6. Define augmentation configs with Pydantic, scaled by a strength parameter"
```
